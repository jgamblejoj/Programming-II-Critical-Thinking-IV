# Programming-II-Critical-Thinking-IV

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating an abstract superclass named Shape, along with three subclasses: Sphere, Cylinder, and Cone. Each subclass represents a distinct three-dimensional form. A toString method is implemented in each subclass to display the objectâ€™s data. The driver class for this assignment stores instances of these three shapes in an array. A for loop is then used to iterate through this array, invoking the toString method of each instance, and subsequently printing the details of each shape to the screen.
